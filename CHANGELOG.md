# Changelog

All notable changes to White Noise iOS are tracked here.

Format:

- Entries are grouped under `Unreleased` first, then by commit date until the
  repo starts tagging releases.
- Each section uses `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Security`, and `Internal`
  where useful.
- This file was initially backfilled from the git log, so older entries are
  intentionally summarized rather than exhaustive.
